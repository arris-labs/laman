# Backlog

One line per raw idea. Picking one up means `/idea` (needs thinking) or
`/plan` (obvious); the line is removed then — as is a line a roadmap cycle
has committed to, which now lives in `docs/ROADMAP.md` instead. Rejected
ideas keep one line below with the reason, so the same idea is not
re-brainstormed. A *measured* defect is not a raw idea: it goes under
[Findings](#findings) below, in the fixed shape.

- Release automation: a `release.yml` that publishes the crate and multi-platform abi3 wheels (Linux, macOS, Windows; manylinux older than 2_34) from a pushed `v*` tag, each behind an environment reviewer, and a `/release` skill, before the first 0.1.0. 0.0.1 went up by hand with one `manylinux_2_34_x86_64` wheel and the sdist
- `laman-check` on crates.io: ARCHITECTURE.md plans to publish it with the solver's first release (Python users get it as `laman.check`); reserve the name then
- Trademark search for "LAMAN" in software classes (WIPO, EUIPO, USPTO) before the solver's first public release (SEED.md §2); the human's
- The GitHub repository `arris-labs/laman` (the crates' `repository` URL and the README's SEED link point there); the human's
- `/retro`'s session digest: port arris's `session-digest` script when the first plan has sessions to mine
- Determinism on more than one OS: CI's test job on macOS and Windows beside Linux, once the digest exists
- Digest of the sketch hashes its JSON text, so a `serde_json` float-printing change would move every blessed digest; hash the f64 bits instead (M2, when `Solution` joins the digest)
- Checker gaps: it does not compare fixed parameters with the sketch's values; `laman-debug`'s runner fills missing expected coordinates with the guesses; `tools/check-layers.sh` is evaded by `use laman as l` or a renamed dependency (a `cargo tree` check would close it)
- Malformed file shapes (an untagged tangent or span form matching no variant) arrive as a serde error without the id; a span with both `line` and `a`/`b` silently takes `line`
- Fuzz target: also call `to_form` and `check(&sk, &sk.coordinates())`; the serde property only mints dense ids, so `to_form`'s dependency-first reordering is covered by one hand test
- The checker's `ANGLE` is absolute; short lines far from the origin can fail it at rounding level: input to the M2 tolerance ADR
- SVG of `sss-triangle` and the belt was not looked at in M0 (only the plate and its conflicting twin); look when M2 first solves them
- Degenerate-point tests for `parallel`, `perpendicular`, `angle`, `equal_length`, `symmetric` and tangent at coincident centres (only `point_on_line`, `distance` and an arc end on its centre have one); the FD strategies never draw an exactly degenerate configuration
- `laman-debug`'s `configuration` strategy and its `Mode` use words GLOSSARY.md lists under _Avoid_ for **Branch**; rename one side. `tests/residual.rs` also has dead `covered()` scaffolding and picks arcs by `name.contains("Arc")`

## Findings

A defect a run measured, one block each:

```
### <slug>
- What: …
- Where: crate, file, function
- Seen: run / commit / seed / date
- Reproduce: the command that replays it
- Measured: the numbers
- State: raw | measured | regression/<slug> | fixed
```

None yet.

## Rejected

- The working name `clevis`: taken on crates.io and PyPI (SEED.md §2)
